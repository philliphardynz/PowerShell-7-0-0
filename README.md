**organise-books.ps1** is a dirty dirty script to quickly take epub/pdf/mobi which are in same folder and sort same book title with multiple formats into a new folder with named after the book title to enable multiple format import into calbire library so that there is only one listing with multiple book formats, you can keep adding books to the base folder and re-running it over the new books and it continue to sort, while leaving the original books in folders alone. But for calbire, I have an import folder that is used to import folders of folders of multiple same book formats.
